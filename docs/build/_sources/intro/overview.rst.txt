Overview

This project presents a modular and autonomous agent-based architecture designed for algorithmic trading systems, with a specific emphasis on dynamic orchestration, protocol-driven communication, and long-term learning. Inspired by distributed systems and reinforcement learning paradigms, the framework provides a scalable and interpretable infrastructure for strategy execution, decision routing, and behavioral optimization.

Motivation
----------

Traditional algorithmic trading pipelines are often hardcoded and monolithic, limiting their adaptability in fast-changing market conditions. To address these limitations, our system decomposes the trading process into discrete agent modulesâ€”each responsible for a well-defined task such as alpha signal generation, risk estimation, or execution. These modules are orchestrated dynamically via a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) controller, allowing for real-time structural evolution of the trading plan.

System Architecture
-------------------

The system is organized into four vertically stacked abstraction layers:

1. **Raw Market Input Layer**  
   Receives real-time or historical financial data streams including prices, order books, macroeconomic signals, and news.

2. **Memory & Learning Layer**  
   Comprises a long-term `MemoryAgent` that stores execution traces and outcomes, and optionally a `DRLPolicyAgent` that evolves strategy structures using reinforcement learning.

3. **Task Execution Layer**  
   Includes modular agent pools for:
   
   - `DataAgents`: ingestion and preprocessing
   - `AlphaAgents`: signal generation
   - `RiskAgents`: exposure and constraint modeling
   - `CostAgents`: transaction cost estimation
   - `ExecutionAgents`: order placement
   - `AnalysisAgents`: post-trade analytics and feedback

4. **Control & Orchestration Layer**  
   At the core lies the `Orchestration` engine, which coordinates task flow based on a DAG produced by the `DAGControllerAgent`. The `RegistrationBus` provides live discovery and status tracking of agents.

Communication Protocols
------------------------

The system is underpinned by four layered communication protocols:

- `MCP` (Multi-agent Control Protocol): for task dispatching and DAG execution
- `ACP` (Agent Communication Protocol): for agent-to-core feedback
- `A2A`: enabling peer-to-peer agent collaboration
- `ANP` (Agent Notification Protocol): for event-driven alerts and system-wide broadcasting

Features and Contributions
--------------------------

- **Modular design**: Plug-and-play agents, enabling experimentation and hybridization
- **Dynamic orchestration**: Online DAG generation and real-time adaptation
- **Learning-enabled evolution**: Integration of memory and reinforcement learning
- **Protocol-oriented inter-agent communication**: Ensures fault tolerance and clarity of message routing

Use Cases
---------

The framework is designed for research and deployment of advanced multi-agent trading systems. Potential use cases include:

- Simulation and backtesting environments
- Multi-strategy agent ensembles with real-time decision-making
- Reinforcement learning experiments in market dynamics
