=============================

Traditional algorithmic trading systems are constrained by rigid rule-based pipelines and limited context-awareness. These systems often fall short in adapting to evolving market conditions, integrating heterogeneous data sources, or composing multi-strategy reasoning in real time.

Our work is motivated by the following challenges:

1. **Strategic Adaptability**: Markets are inherently non-stationary and adversarial. Rigid pipelines cannot support the dynamic recomposition of strategies or agent roles needed to respond effectively to regime shifts.
2. **Coordination Across Heterogeneity**: Financial intelligence spans multiple domains, from real-time price feeds and economic indicators to sentiment analysis and alpha signal generation. Integrating this heterogeneity requires a distributed yet coherent multi-agent planning mechanism.
3. **Decentralized Intelligence**: Scaling trading systems beyond monolithic architectures demands localized intelligence and negotiation among agents, rather than top-down control.
4. **Explainability and Auditability**: In regulated environments, it is imperative that every strategic decision can be traced back to agent context, task lineage, and orchestration flow.

In response to these challenges, **FinAgent Orchestration** provides a programmable substrate for agentic coordination, memory-based decision tracking, and protocol-mediated communication, paving the way toward a more autonomous and auditable future of financial automation.
