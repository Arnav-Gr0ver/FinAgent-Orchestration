====================
Alpha Agent Pool
====================

Overview
--------

The **Alpha Agent Pool** serves as the strategy engine of the FinAgent Orchestration system. These agents are responsible for **hypothesis generation, signal fusion, and tactical portfolio recommendations**, acting as autonomous financial analysts and strategists.

Design Objectives
------------------

- Generate diverse, hypothesis-driven trading signals.
- Enable peer cooperation and strategy ensemble methods.
- Embed domain priors and risk constraints into reasoning flows.
- Maintain explainability, traceability, and adaptivity over time.

Agent Specialization
---------------------

Alpha Agents are instantiated with different modeling philosophies, horizons, and alpha hypotheses. Representative types include:

- **MomentumAlphaAgent**: Uses trend continuation signals and technical breakouts.
- **MeanReversionAgent**: Detects overbought/oversold patterns and local reversions.
- **LLMAlphaAgent**: Fuses structured data with unstructured news for language-conditioned decisions.
- **MultiFactorAlphaAgent**: Combines value, growth, quality, and sentiment signals in ranked alpha scores.

Architecture and Protocol
--------------------------

- **Communication**: Agents operate under **MCP** orchestration and may perform **A2A collaboration** through signal exchange, ensembling, or voting mechanisms.
- **Strategy Lifecycle**: Agents receive structured data contexts and respond with ranked actions, signal scores, or executable plans.
- **Feedback and Memory**: Each alpha decision is logged with contextual evidence, contributing to model evaluation and continual learning.

Design Principles
------------------

- **Autonomous Hypothesis Testing**: Agents are capable of independently proposing and validating ideas.
- **Ensemble Construction**: Results from multiple agents are integrated via weighted voting, reward history, or confidence propagation.
- **Risk-Constrained Execution**: Generated signals are shaped by constraints passed from the Execution Layer or Risk Manager.
