==================
Data Agent Pool
==================

Overview
--------

The **Data Agent Pool** forms the sensory and contextual foundation of the FinAgent Orchestration framework. It is responsible for the **autonomous ingestion, normalization, and contextualization** of heterogeneous financial data streams, enabling downstream reasoning agents to access structured and trusted information.

Design Objectives
------------------

- Ensure modular access to diverse financial data sources.
- Enable composable data pipelines for transformation and alignment.
- Maintain provenance and auditability of all data-fetching operations.
- Support protocol-driven interoperability and agent reuse.

Agent Specialization
---------------------

Each agent within the pool is designed to specialize in a **specific data domain**, with its own tools, rate limits, and error handling logic. Examples include:

- **YFinanceAgent**: Historical OHLCV data, fundamental indicators.
- **PolygonAgent**: Real-time ticks, market depth, and high-frequency snapshots.
- **NewsAgent**: Live news streams, event detection, and sentiment tagging.
- **EconAgent**: Macroeconomic indicators, forecasts, and calendar-based data.

Architecture and Protocol
--------------------------

- **Communication**: All agents expose callable interfaces via the **Multi-agent Control Protocol (MCP)** and can optionally participate in **A2A message exchange** for low-latency synchronization (e.g., context propagation).
- **Execution**: The Orchestrator composes data retrieval DAGs using tools declared by each agent.
- **Memory Integration**: Data responses are versioned, timestamped, and archived into the memory subsystem for future replay or training tasks.

Design Principles
------------------

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent only handles its own data source, avoiding logic entanglement.
- **Context-Aware Pipelining**: Agents can be chained to produce layered outputs (e.g., raw → filtered → aligned).
- **Redundancy and Voting**: When multiple sources exist for the same signal, the system uses ranking or consensus rules to resolve discrepancies.
